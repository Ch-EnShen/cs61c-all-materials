# FUNCTION: Writes a matrix of integers into a binary file
#   If any file operation fails or doesn't write the proper number of bytes,
#   exit the program with exit code 1.
# FILE FORMAT:
#   The first 8 bytes of the file will be two 4 byte ints representing the
#   numbers of rows and columns respectively. Every 4 bytes thereafter is an
#   element of the matrix in row-major order.
# Arguments:
#   a0 (char*) is the pointer to string representing the filename
#   a1 (int*)  is the pointer to the start of the matrix in memory
#   a2 (int)   is the number of rows in the matrix
#   a3 (int)   is the number of columns in the matrix
# Returns:
#   None
#
# If you receive an fopen error or eof, 
# this function exits with error code 53.
# If you receive an fwrite error or eof,
# this function exits with error code 54.
# If you receive an fclose error or eof,
# this function exits with error code 55.
